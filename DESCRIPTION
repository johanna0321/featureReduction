Description: This package reduces the number of named features in a
    metabolomics, lipidomics, or similar type dataset. User provides a list 
    of named features in the dataset with a classification/group ID for each 
    feature in the dataset. A representative value for each predefined metabolite
    group is created by weighing metabolites using principle component analysis.
